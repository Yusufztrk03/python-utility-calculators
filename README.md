# 🔢 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - Python Edition

This project is a clean implementation of fundamental arithmetic operations. It focuses on the precision of floating-point calculations and structured error handling.

## 🔍 The Logic
A calculator is the most basic form of a decision-making system. This tool ensures that the mathematical inputs are processed through a strictly defined logic gate to provide 100% accuracy.

## 🛠️ Features
* **Core Operations:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
* **Input Validation:** Prevents system crashes from invalid data types.
* **Zero-Division Protection:** Embedded logic to handle mathematical paradoxes.
